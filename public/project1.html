        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Project Title: Travel Whiz – Your Personal Travel Assistant</p>
        
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Despite the availability of numerous travel applications and blogs offering travel tips, many users still find it difficult to organize trips that cater to their preferences.

Our app focuses on personalizing the user experience by recommending destinations based on user preferences and seasonal trends, offering seamless bookings (flights, hotels, and car rentals), and providing personalized trip itineraries. With Travel Whiz, users can focus on enjoying their journey without the stress of planning.</p>

        <p><b>Key features include:</b></p>

        <h2>Personas Development</h2>
        <p>From our research, we identified key user behavior patterns and developed six personas to guide our design process. These personas helped us prioritize features and tailor the user experience to specific needs, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Busy professionals seeking efficiency in travel planning.</li>
            <li>Group travelers looking for shared itineraries and personalized recommendations.</li>
        </ul>

        <img id= "personas" src="/images/TW/Persona1.png" alt="Persona 1">
        <img id= "personas" src="/images/TW/Persona2.png" alt="Persona 2">
        <img id= "personas" src="/images/TW/Persona3.png" alt="Persona 3">

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>Our design process followed a user-centered approach, incorporating research insights into every stage of development. We used the Five Planes of UX to structure the project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Strategy Plane:</b> 
                <p>We defined the product objectives based on user needs, ensuring that the app focused on a seamless, hassle-free experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Scope Plane:</b> 
                <p>We identified key features, such as booking flights, accommodations, and car rentals, alongside feedback collection and travel recommendations.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Structure Plane:</b> 
                <p>We designed the information architecture, ensuring logical and intuitive navigation through the app’s core features.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Skeleton Plane:</b> 
                <p>We outlined the layout of buttons, controls, and images to create an efficient and aesthetically pleasing interface.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Surface Plane:</b> 
                <p>The final design featured a clean, modern visual aesthetic with a color palette that reflects the excitement of travel, while the typography (Roboto and Poppins) ensured readability and accessibility.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Card Sorting & Information Architecture</h2>
        <p>We used both open and closed card sorting methods to design the information architecture of Travel Whiz.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Closed Card Sorting:</b> 
                <p>Participants sorted travel-related content into pre-defined categories, allowing us to refine the app's content organization.</p>
            </li>
            <img id= "sorting" src="/images/TW/CardSortingOpen.png" alt="Open Card Sorting">
            <li><b>Open Card Sorting:</b> 
                <p>Participants created their own categories, providing insight into how users naturally group travel-related information. This helped us ensure that the app’s navigation aligned with user expectations.</p>
            </li>
            <img id= "sorting" src="/images/TW/CardSortingClose.png" alt="Close Card Sorting">
            <li><b>Information Architecture</b> </li>
                <img id= "sorting" src="/images/TW/InformationArchitecture.png" alt="Close Card Sorting">
            <li><b>Typography and color palette</b> </li>    
                <img id= "sorting" src="/images/TW/ColorPalette.png" alt="Color Palette And Typography">
            <li><b>Logo</b></li>

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>Usability testing played a crucial role in refining Travel Whiz’s user interface. We tested the app with 20 participants (aged 20-40, travel lovers) to evaluate the user experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Testing Objectives:</b> 
                <p>Measure the time required to complete key tasks (e.g., creating an account, navigating the app), identify unintended task sequences or extra steps, and evaluate the visual interface, including the placement of buttons, link size, and color contrast.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Key Insights:</b> 
                <p>Participants found the navigation intuitive and easy to use, feedback highlighted a desire for more vibrant colors to enhance the visual appeal, and all participants were able to contact customer support and give their feedback with ease, confirming the effectiveness of the features.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img id="usabilityTesting" src="/images/TW/UsabilityTestingMetrics.png" alt="Usability Testing Metrics">
